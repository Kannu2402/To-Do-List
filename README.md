 # 📝 To-Do List (Command-Line Interface)

This is a simple **Task Management (To-Do List)** application built using **Python**. The project runs entirely in the **command line (CLI)** and allows users to add, update, delete, and view tasks.

> 🔧 No external libraries were used — 100% core Python!

## 🚀 Features

- Add multiple tasks
- Update existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- View all tasks
- Clean exit with error handling

---

## 🧠 How It Works

When you run the script:
1. It asks how many tasks you want to start with.
2. Then it displays a menu with options:
   - Add Task
   - Update Task
   - Delete Task
   - View Tasks
   - Exit

The program uses a **loop** and **error handling** to ensure smooth user experience.
